Can you see now?- (CHUCKLES) No. - How about now?(BOTH LAUGH)All right.Ready? Three fingers.COOPER: Nice!LAURA: Nice throw, kiddo.COOPER: Here you go.Hey, you guys want mayo? Or mustard?Or both?Who puts mayo on a hot dog?Probably your brothers.Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, Mama.LAURA: Got it!Nate, mayo or mustard?How about ketchup?LAURA: Or ketchup. I got ketchup, too.BARTON: Mind your elbow.(LAUGHS) Good job, hawk-eye.Go get your arrow. (CHUCKLES)LAURA: Hey, guys!Enough practice. Soup\\'s on!BARTON: All right.We\\'re coming. We\\'re hungry.Lila, let\\'s go.Lila?Honey?Hey, babe?- (THUNDER RUMBLING) - Babe?Babe?(WHISTLES) Boys!Boys!Laura!(THUNDER RUMBLING)(PSYCHEDELIC ROCK SONG PLAYING)- (GRUNTS) - (OBJECT CLATTERS)You don\\'t need to do that.Because, uh, you\\'re just holding the position.- Oh, yeah. - (GRUNTS)- That was close. - (GRUNTS)That\\'s a goal. We are now one apiece.I would like to try again.We\\'re tied up. Feel the tension?It\\'s fun.That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win.And you\\'ve won.Congratulations.Fair game.Good sport.You have fun?It was fun.- (CLICKS) - (GRUNTS)(HELMET WHIRRING)(SIGHS)This thing on?Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.(EXHALES DEEPLY) If you find this recording...don\\'t post it on social media.It\\'s gonna be a real tearjerker.I don\\'t know if you\\'re ever gonna see these.I don\\'t even know if you\\'re still...Oh, God, I hope so. Today\\'s day 21. No, uh, 22. You know, if it wasn\\'t for the existential terror... of staring into the literal void of space, I\\'d say I\\'m feeling a little better today. Infection\\'s run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there. Oh, you\\'d love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. So, the fuel cells were cracked during battle... and we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge... and bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time. Uh, but it\\'s now dead in the water. Thousand light years from the nearest 7-Eleven. Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning... and that\\'ll be it. Pep, I know I said no more surprises... but I gotta say I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... Well, you know what it looks like. Don\\'t feel bad about this.I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks...and then move on with enormous guilt...I should probably lie down for a minute.Go rest my eyes.(SIGHS)Please know...when I drift off, it\\'ll be like every night lately.I\\'m fine. Totally fine.I dream about you.Because it\\'s always you.(CLICKS, POWERS OFF)(GROANING SOFTLY)(BREATHES DEEPLY)(DISTANT BOOM)(RUMBLING)(TONY PANTING)Couldn\\'t stop him.Neither could I.Hang on.I lost the kid.Tony, we lost.Is, uh...?- Oh, good. - Oh, my God!Oh, my God! (SOBBING)It\\'s okay.RHODES: It\\'s been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.NATASHA: World governments are in pieces.The parts that are still working......are trying to take a census and it looks like he did...He did exactly what he said he was gonna do.Thanos wiped out......50% of all living creatures.Where is he now? Where?We don\\'t know.He just opened a portal and walked through.(SIGHS)What\\'s wrong with him?ROCKET: Oh, he\\'s pissed.He thinks he failed.Which, of course, he did...but there\\'s a lot of that going around, ain\\'t there?Honestly, until this exact secondI thought you were a Build-A-Bear.Maybe I am.We\\'ve been hunting Thanos for three weeks now.Deep space scans...and satellites, and we got nothing.Tony, you fought him.Who told you that?I didn\\'t fight him.No, he wiped my face with a planet...while the Bleecker Street magiciangave away the store.That\\'s what happened.There was no fight, \\'cause he\\'s not beatable.Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?Uh... (SPUTTERS)I saw this coming a few years back.I had a vision. I didn\\'t wanna believe it.Thought I was dreaming.Tony, I\\'m gonna need you to focus.And I needed you.As in, past tense.That trumps what you need. It\\'s too late, buddy.Sorry.(SNIFFS) You know what I need? I need a shave.And I believe I remember telling all youse...Tony, Tony!...alive and otherwise, that what we neededwas a suit of armor around the world.Remember that?Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not.That\\'s what we needed.Well, that didn\\'t work out, did it?I said we\\'d lose.You said, \"We\\'ll do that together, too.\"And guess what, Cap?We lost.And you weren\\'t there.But that\\'s what we do, right?Our best work after the fact? We\\'re the \"Avengers.\"We\\'re the \"Avengers,\" not the \"Pre-vengers.\"- Okay. - Right?You made your point. Just sit down, okay?Okay. No, no, here\\'s my point. You know what?- She\\'s great by the way. - Tony, you\\'re sick. Sit down.TONY: We need you. You\\'re new blood.Bunch of tired old mules. I got nothing for you, Cap.I got no coordinates...no clues, no strategies, no options.Zero. Zip. Nada.No trust, liar.(TONY BREATHING SHAKILY)Here, take this.You find him, you put that on...you hide.- STEVE: Tony! - I\\'m fine.Let me...RHODES: Bruce gave him a sedative.He\\'s gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.CAROL: You guys take care of him...and I\\'ll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back.Where are you going?To kill Thanos.NATASHA: Hey.You know, we usually work as a team here...and, uh, between you and I, morale\\'s a little fragile.We realize up there is more your territory,but this is our fight, too.You even know where he is?I know people who might.NEBULA: Don\\'t bother.I can tell you where Thanos is.Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me.And when he worked, he talked about his Great Plan.Even disassembled, I wanted to please him.I\\'d ask...where would we go once his plan was complete?And his answer was always the same.\"To the Garden.\"That\\'s cute. Thanos has a retirement plan.So, where is he?When Thanos snapped his fingers...Earth became ground zero for a power surgeof ridiculously cosmic proportions.No one\\'s ever seen anything like it.Until two days ago...on this planet.Thanos is there.He used the stones again.BANNER: Hey, hey, hey. (CHUCKLES)We\\'d be going in shorthanded, you know?RHODES: Look, he\\'s still got the stones, so...So, let\\'s get \\'em.Use them to bring everyone back.BANNER: Just like that?Yeah. Just like that.Even if there\\'s a small chance that we can undo this...I mean, we owe it to everyone who\\'s not in this room to try.If we do this, how do we knowit\\'s gonna end any differently than it did before?Because before you didn\\'t have me.Hey, new girl?Everybody in this room is about that superhero life.And if you don\\'t mind my asking,where the hell have you been all this time?There are a lot of other planets in the universe.And unfortunately, they didn\\'t have you guys.(RUMBLING)I like this one.Let\\'s go get this son of a bitch.Okay.Who here hasn\\'t been to space?- Why? - (CAROL CHUCKLES)You better not throw up on my ship.Approaching jump in three...two, one.(OVER SPEAKERS) I\\'ll head down for recon. This is gonna work, Steve.I know it will.\\'Cause I don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do if it doesn\\'t. No satellites. No ships. No armies. No ground defenses of any kind. It\\'s just him. And that\\'s enough.(BIRDS CHIRPING)(POT CLANKING)(GRUNTS)(CHOKING)(GRUNTING)(SCREAMING)(THANOS GROANING)Oh, no.(GROANS)Where are they?- (GROANING) - Answer the question.The universe required correction.After that, the stones served no purpose...beyond temptation.You murdered trillions!- You should be grateful. - (BANNER GRUNTS)Where are the stones?Gone.Reduced to atoms.You used them two days ago!I used the stones to destroy the stones.It nearly killed me.But the work is done.It always will be.I am inevitable.We have to tear this place apart. He has to be lying!NEBULA: My father is many things.A liar is not one of them.Ah.Thank you, daughter.Perhaps I treated you too harshly.(GRUNTS)BANNER: What?What did you do?I went for the head.MAN: So... ...I, uh, went on a date the other day.It\\'s the first time in five years.You know? I\\'m sitting there at dinner.I didn\\'t even know what to talk about.What did you talk about?Eh, same old crap. You know, how things have changed.My job, his job.How much we miss the Mets.And then things got quiet...then he cried as they were serving the salads.What about you?I cried just before dessert.But I\\'m seeing him again tomorrow, so...That\\'s great.You did the hardest part. You took the jump.You didn\\'t know where you were gonna come down.And that\\'s it. That\\'s those littlebrave baby steps we gotta take...to try and become whole again, try and find purpose.I went in the ice in \\'45,right after I met the love of my life.Woke up 70 years later.You gotta move on.Gotta move on.The world is in our hands.It\\'s left to us, guys.And we gotta do something with it.Otherwise...Thanos should\\'ve killed all of us.(RAT SQUEAKING)(BEEPS)(BEEPING)(POWERING UP)(GROANS)(BLOWS)What the hell?(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)(POWERS DOWN)Hope?(INAUDIBLE)Kid!Hey, kid!What the hell happened here?(BIRD CAWING)Oh, my God!Oh, please!Please, please!No, no, no. No.No.Excuse me. Sorry.Oh, Cassie, no.No, no, no.No, no.Please, please, please. No, Cassie.What?(GASPING)Cassie?Dad?(SOBBING)(SOBS)- You\\'re so big! - (BOTH LAUGH)ROCKET: (ON SPEAKERS) Yeah. We boarded that highly-suspect warship Danvers pinged. It was an infectious garbage scow. So, thanks for the hot tip. Well, you were closer. ROCKET: Yeah. And now we smell like garbage. You get a reading on those tremors? \\'Twas a mild subduction under the African plate. Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?OKOYE: Nat. It\\'s an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it. Carol, are we seeing you here next month? Not likely. What? You gonna get another haircut? Listen, fur face. I\\'m covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth are happening everywhere. On thousands of planets. All right, all right. That\\'s a good point. That\\'s a good point. So, you might not see me for a long time. All right. Uh, well...This channel\\'s always active.So, if anything goes sideways...anyone\\'s making trouble where they shouldn\\'t...comes through me.(ASSENTS IN XHOSA) Okay. All right. Good luck. (SIGHS SOFTLY)Where are you?RHODES: Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys... never even had a chance to get their guns off. It\\'s probably a rival gang. Except it isn\\'t. It\\'s definitely Barton. What he\\'s done here... what he\\'s been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left... I gotta tell you, there\\'s a part of me that doesn\\'t even wanna find him. Will you find out where he\\'s going next? Nat? Please? Okay. (BREATHES SHAKILY)STEVE: You know, I\\'d offer to cook you dinner...but you seem pretty miserable already.NATASHA: You here to do your laundry?And to see a friend.Clearly, your friend is fine.You know, I saw a pod of whaleswhen I was coming over the bridge.- In the Hudson? - There\\'s fewer ships...cleaner water.You know, if you\\'re about to tell meto look on the bright side...Um...I\\'m about to hit you in the headwith a peanut butter sandwich.Hmm.Sorry.Force of habit.You know, I keep telling everybodythey should move on...and grow.Some do.But not us.If I move on, who does this?Maybe it doesn\\'t need to be done.I used to have nothing.And then I got this.This job.This family.And I was better because of it.And even though they\\'re gone...I\\'m still trying to be better.I think we both need to get a life.You first.(DEVICE CHIMES)SCOTT: (ON SPEAKERS) Oh, hi, hi! Uh, is anyone home? This is, uh, Scott Lang. We met a few years ago at the airport... in Germany? I was the guy that got really big. I had a mask on. - You wouldn\\'t recognize me. - Is this an old message?SCOTT: Ant-Man? I know you know that. It\\'s the front gate.SCOTT: I really need to talk to you guys. (MUTTERING TO HIMSELF)STEVE: Scott.Are you okay?Yeah.Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?Only to make conversation.All right, so...five years ago, right before...Thanos...I was in a place called the quantum realm.The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe.To get in there, you have to be incredibly small.Hope. She\\'s my, um...She was my...She was supposed to pull me out.And then Thanos happened...and I got stuck in there.I\\'m sorry, that must have been a very long five years.Yeah, but that\\'s just it.It wasn\\'t.For me, it was five hours.See, the rules of the quantum realmaren\\'t like they are up here.Everything is unpredictable.Is that anybody\\'s sandwich?I\\'m starving.Scott.What are you talking about?(MUFFLED) So...what I\\'m saying is...time works differently in the quantum realm.The only problem is right nowwe don\\'t have a way to navigate it.But what if we did?I can\\'t stop thinking about it.What if we could somehow control the chaos...and we could navigate it?What if there was a way...that we could enter the quantum realmat a certain point in time...but then exit the quantum realmat another point in time?Like...- Like before Thanos. - STEVE: Wait.Are you talking about a time machine?No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine.This is more like a...Yeah. Like a time machine.I know, it\\'s crazy. It\\'s crazy.(STAMMERS) But I can\\'t stop thinking about it.There\\'s gotta be...some way... (SIGHS)- It\\'s crazy. - NATASHA: Scott.I get emails from a raccoon...so nothing sounds crazy anymore.So, who do we talk to about this?Chow time!Maguna.Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch? Define \"lunch\" - or be disintegrated. - Okay.You should not be wearing that, okay?That is part of a special anniversary giftI\\'m making for Mom.There you go. You thinking about lunch?I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.- No. - That\\'s what you want.How did you find this?- Garage. - Really?- Were you looking for it? - No.- I found it, though. - Hmm.You like going in the garage, huh?So does Daddy. (GRUNTS)It\\'s fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her.So, I\\'m gonna...(STAMMERS) No. We know what it sounds like.Tony, after everything you\\'ve seen,is anything really impossible?Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck scale...which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition.Can we agree on that?Thank you.In layman\\'s terms, it means you\\'re not coming home.- I did. - No.You accidentally survived. (SIGHS)It\\'s a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.And now you wanna pull a... What do you call it?A time heist?Yeah, a time heist. Of course.Why didn\\'t we think of this before?Oh, because it\\'s laughable. Because it\\'s a pipe dream.The stones are in the past.We could go back, we could get them.We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back.Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?I don\\'t believe we would.Gotta say it. I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.However, high hopes won\\'t help...if there\\'s no logical, tangible wayfor me to safely execute said time heist.I believe the most likely outcomewill be our collective demise.Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.All right? It means no talking to our past selves...no betting on sporting events.I\\'m gonna stop you right there, Scott.Are you seriously telling methat your plan to save the universe...is based on Back to the Future? - Is it? - No.Good. You had me worried there.\\'Cause that would be horseshit.That\\'s not how quantum physics works.Tony.We have to take a stand.We did stand. And yet, here we are.SCOTT: I know you got a lot on the line.You got a wife, a daughter.But I lost someone very important to me.A lotta people did.And now, now we have a chance to bring her back...to bring everyone back,and you\\'re telling me that you won\\'t even...That\\'s right, Scott. I won\\'t even.- I can\\'t. - (DOOR CLOSES)(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me to come and save you.Good job. I\\'m saved.I wish you were coming here to ask me something else.Anything else.I\\'m honestly happy to see you guys, I just...Oh, look, the table\\'s set for six.Tony. I get it.And I\\'m happy for you. I really am.But this is a second chance.I got my second chance right here, Cap.Can\\'t roll the dice on it.If you don\\'t talk shop, you can stay for lunch.Well, he\\'s scared.STEVE: He\\'s not wrong.SCOTT: Yeah, but, I mean, what are we gonna do?We need him. What, are we gonna stop?No, I wanna do it right.We\\'re gonna need a really big brain.Bigger than his?Come on, I feel like I\\'m the only one eating here.Try some of that.Have some eggs.I\\'m so confused.These are confusing times. (CHUCKLES)Right, no, no. That\\'s not what I meant.Nah, I get it. I\\'m kidding!I know, it\\'s crazy.I\\'m wearing shirts now.Yeah. What? How? Why?Five years ago, we got our asses beat.Except it was worse for me...\\'cause I lost twice.First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...and then, we all lost.No one blamed you, Bruce.I did.For years, I\\'ve been treating the Hulklike he\\'s some kind of disease...something to get rid of.But then, I start looking at him as the cure.Eighteen months in the gamma lab.I put the brains and the brawn together...and now, look at me.Best of both worlds.- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk? - Yes.Can we get a photo?100%, little person.Come on, step on up. Do you mind?- Oh, yeah, yeah. - SMART HULK: Thanks.Say \"green.\"- FANS: Green. - Green.Did you get that?That\\'s a good one.Did you want to grab one with me? I\\'m Ant-Man.They\\'re Hulk fans. They don\\'t know Ant-Man.- Nobody does. - No, he wants you to take- a picture with him. - I don\\'t want a picture.Stranger danger.Yeah, look, he\\'s even saying no, he doesn\\'t.I get it. I don\\'t want it, either.But come on. The kid...I don\\'t want a picture with them.- He\\'s gonna feel bad. - Sorry.They\\'re happy to do it. They said they\\'ll do it.- SCOTT: I don\\'t want to do it. - We can do it.- SMART HULK: No, you feel bad. - Take the goddamn phone.SMART HULK: Okay.GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.SMART HULK: No, it was great, kids. Thank you very much.ALL: Hulk out!STEVE: Bruce.Dab.- Bruce. - Listen to your mom.She knows better.About what we were saying.Right.The whole time travel do-over?Eh, guys, it\\'s outside of my area of expertise.Well, you pulled this off.I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible, too.I\\'ve got a mild inspiration.I\\'d like to see if it checks out.So, I\\'d like to run one last simbefore we pack it in for the night.This time, in the shape of a Mobius strip,inverted, please.FRIDAY: Processing. Right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle...factoring in spectral decomp.- That\\'ll take a second. - FRIDAY: Just a moment. And don\\'t worry if it doesn\\'t pan out. I\\'m just kinda... Model rendered. (PUFFS)(EXHALES SHARPLY)Shit!MORGAN STARK: Shit!(WHISPERS) What are you doing up, little miss?- Shit. - Nope. We don\\'t say that.Only Mommy says that word.She coined it. It belongs to her.Why are you up?\\'Cause I\\'ve got some important shit going on here!Why do you think?No, I got something on my mind.I got something on my mind.Was it juice pops?Sure was.That\\'s extortion. That\\'s a word.What kind you want?Great minds think alike.Juice pops exactly...was on my mind.You done? Yeah?Now you are.Here. Wipe.Good. That face goes there.Tell me a story.A story.Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.That is a horrible story.Come on, that\\'s your favorite story.Love you tons.I love you 3,000.Wow.(WHISPERS) 3,000. That\\'s crazy.Go to bed or I\\'ll sell all your toys.- Night night. - (DOOR CLOSES)Not that it\\'s a competition...but she loves me 3,000.Does she, now?You were somewhere in the low 6 to 900 range.(CHUCKLES)Whatcha reading?Just a book on composting.What\\'s new with composting?- Interesting science... - I figured it out.By the way.And, you know,just so we\\'re talking about the same thing...Time travel.What?Wow.That\\'s amazing...and terrifying.That\\'s right.(SIGHS)We got really lucky.Yeah.I know.A lot of people didn\\'t.Nope. And I can\\'t help everybody.Sorta seems like you can.Not if I stop.I can put a pin in it right now and stop.Tony...trying to get you to stop...has been one of the few failures of my entire life.Something tells me...I should put it in a lockboxand drop it to the bottom of the lake...and go to bed.But would you be able to rest?SMART HULK: Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one.Scott, fire up...the, uh, van thing.STEVE: Breakers are set.Emergency generators are on standby.Good, because if we blow the grid,I don\\'t want to lose, uh, Tiny here in the 1950s.- Excuse me? - He\\'s kidding.You can\\'t say things like that.(STAMMERS) It was a bad joke.You were kidding, right?I have no idea. We\\'re talking about time travel here.Either it\\'s all a joke, or none of it is.We\\'re good!Get your helmet on.Scott, I\\'m gonna send you back a week...let you walk around for an hour,then bring you back in 10 seconds.Make sense?Perfectly not confusing.Good luck, Scott. You got this.You\\'re right. I do, Captain America.On a count of three...Three, two, one.(MACHINE WHIRS)Uh... Guys?This doesn\\'t feel right.STEVE: What is this?- What\\'s going on? - NATASHA: Who is that?- Hold on. - Is that Scott?Yes, it\\'s Scott.- What\\'s going on, Bruce? - Oh, my back!- What is this? - Hold on a second.Could I get a little space here?Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you bring him back?I\\'m working on it.(BEEPING)It\\'s a baby.- It\\'s Scott. - STEVE: As a baby.- SMART HULK: He\\'ll grow. - Bring Scott back.When I say kill the power, kill the power.Oh, my God.And... kill it!Somebody peed my pants.Oh, thank God.But I don\\'t know if it was baby me or old me.Or just me me.Time travel!What?I see this as an absolute win.- (TIRES SQUEALING) - (ENGINE ROARING)Why the long face?Let me guess, he turned into a baby.Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?It\\'s the EPR Paradox.Instead of pushing Lang through time,you might\\'ve wound up...pushing time through Lang.It\\'s tricky, dangerous.Somebody could have cautioned you against it.You did.Oh, did I?Well, thank God I\\'m here.Regardless, I fixed it.A fully functioning time-space GPS.I just want peace.Turns out resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.Me, too.We got a shot at getting these stones,but I gotta tell you my priorities.Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes.Keep what I found, I have to, at all costs.And maybe not die trying.Would be nice.Sounds like a deal.(SIGHS)Tony, I don\\'t know.Why?He made it for you.Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garagebefore Morgan takes it sledding.Thank you, Tony.Will you keep that a little quiet?Didn\\'t bring one for the whole team.We are getting the whole team, yeah?We\\'re working on that right now.(SPACESHIP ENGINE HUMMING)ROCKET: Hey, Humie.Where\\'s Big Green?The kitchen, I think.That\\'s awesome.Rhodey, careful on re-entry.There\\'s an idiot in the landing zone.Oh, God.WAR MACHINE: What\\'s up, Regular-Sized Man? (CALYPSO ROCK SONG PLAYING)ROCKET: Kind of a step down from the golden palacesand the magic hammers and whatnot.Hey, have a little compassion, pal.First, they lost Asgard, then half their people.They\\'re probably just happy to have a home.You shouldn\\'t have come.Ah!Valkyrie!Great to see you, angry girl!I think I liked you better either of the other ways.This is Rocket.How ya doing?He won\\'t see you.It\\'s that bad, huh?We only see him once a monthwhen he comes in for \"supplies.\"It\\'s that bad.Yeah.(DOOR CREAKS)What the...?- (SNIFFS) - (FLOORBOARD CREAKING)Whew! Something died in here!- (BOTTLES CLINK) - SMART HULK: Hello? Thor!THOR: Are you here about the cable?The Cinemax went out two weeks ago...and the sports are all kinda fuzzy and whatnot.SMART HULK: Thor?(LAUGHING) Boys! Oh, my God!Oh, my God, it\\'s so good to see you!Come here, cuddly little rascal.- Yeah, no, I\\'m good. I\\'m good. - (THOR MOANS AND LAUGHS)That\\'s not necessary.Hulk, you know my friends Miek and Korg, right?- Hey, boys! - SMART HULK: Hey, guys.Long time no see.Beer\\'s in the bucket.Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi.No password, obviously.Thor, he\\'s back.That kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again.Noobmaster.KORG: Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead.I am sick of this.Noobmaster, hey, it\\'s Thor again.You know, the God of Thunder.Listen, bud, if you don\\'t log off this game immediately...I am gonna fly over to your house,come down to that basement you\\'re hiding in...rip off your arms, and shove them up your butt!Oh, that\\'s right, yes!Go cry to your father, you little weasel.Thank you, Thor.Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?Thank you very much. I will.So, you guys want a drink? What are we drinking?I\\'ve got beer, tequila, all sorts of things.(CHUCKLES)SMART HULK: Buddy.- You all right? - Yes, I\\'m fine. Why?Why, don\\'t I look all right?You look like melted ice cream.(LAUGHS)So, what\\'s up? You just here for a hang, or what?- We need your help. - Mm.There might be a chance we could fix everything.What, like the cable?(BURPS) \\'Cause that\\'s been driving me bananas for weeks.Like Thanos.Don\\'t say that name.Um, yeah, we don\\'t actually say that name in here.SMART HULK: Please take your hand off me.Now, I know that guy...might scare you.Why would I be...? (SCOFFS)Why would I be scared of that guy?I\\'m the one who killed that guy, remember?Hmm.Anyone else here kill that guy?Nope.Didn\\'t think so.Korg, why don\\'t you, uh, tell everybodywho chopped Thanos\\' big head off?Um, Stormbreaker?THOR: Who was swinging Stormbreaker?I get it. You\\'re in a rough spot, okay?I\\'ve been there myself.And you want to know who helped me out of it?(SLURRING) Was it Natasha?It was you.You helped me.So, why don\\'t you ask...the Asgardians down there...how much my help is worth?The ones that are left, anyway.I think we could bring them back.(CHUCKLES) Stop.Stop, okay? (SNIFFS)I know you think I\\'m down herewallowing in my own self-pity...waiting to be rescued and saved...but I\\'m fine, okay. We\\'re fine, aren\\'t we?Oh, we\\'re good here, mate.So, whatever it is that you\\'re offering, we\\'re not into it.Don\\'t care. Couldn\\'t care less.Goodbye.(CHUCKLES)SMART HULK: We need you, pal.(SNIFFS)(CHUCKLES QUIETLY)There\\'s beer on the ship.(BOTTLE CLATTERS)What kind?(MAN SHOUTS IN JAPANESE)- (GRUNTS) - (GROANS)(MAN SHOUTS IN JAPANESE)(GROANS)(GUNFIRE)(GRUNTS)(GRUNTS)(SCOFFS)(BOTH GRUNTING)(SHOUTS IN JAPANESE)(YELLS)(GAGGING)(IN ENGLISH) What I want you can\\'t give me.You shouldn\\'t be here.Neither should you.I\\'ve got a job to do.NATASHA: Is that what you\\'re calling this?Killing all these peopleisn\\'t gonna bring your family back.We found something.A chance, maybe.(SIGHS) Don\\'t.Don\\'t what?Don\\'t give me hope.I\\'m sorry I couldn\\'t give it to you sooner.(ROCK AND ROLL SONG PLAYING)You\\'re drifting left.One side there, Lebowski.Ratchet, how\\'s it going?It\\'s Rocket.Take it easy. You\\'re only a genius on Earth, pal.(THOR BELCHES)RHODES: Time travel suit, not bad.Hey, hey, hey! Easy! Easy!I\\'m being very careful.No, you\\'re being very Hulky.I\\'m being careful.These are Pym Particles, all right?And ever since Hank Pym got snappedout of existence, this is it.This is what we have. We\\'re not making any more.- Scott, calm down. - SCOTT: Sorry.We\\'ve got enough for one round-trip each. That\\'s it.No do-overs.Plus two test runs.- (SUIT FASTENING) - (YELLS)One test run.(SIGHS)All right. I\\'m not ready for this.BARTON: I\\'m game.I\\'ll do it.SMART HULK: Clint, now you\\'re gonna feela little discombobulated from the chronoshift.Don\\'t worry about that.RHODES: Wait a second. Let me ask you something.If we can do this, you know...go back in time, why don\\'t we just find baby Thanos?You know, and...First of all, that\\'s horrible.It\\'s Thanos.And secondly, time doesn\\'t work that way.Changing the past doesn\\'t change the future.Look, we go back, we get the stonesbefore Thanos gets them...Thanos doesn\\'t have the stones. Problem solved.- Bingo. - That\\'s not how it works.Well, that\\'s what I heard.Wait, but who? Who told you that? Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop... - Time After Time. - Quantum Leap. Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time. Hot Tub Time Machine. Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted\\'s Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel. Die Hard. No, that\\'s not one.This is known.I don\\'t know why everyone believes that,but that isn\\'t true.Think about it. If you travel to the past...that past becomes your future...and your former present becomes the past...which can\\'t now be changed by your new future.Exactly.So Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit?- All right, Clint. - (BEEPING)We\\'re going in three, two...one.(GRUNTS)(YELLING)(PANTING)(GASPS)(CONTINUES PANTING)LILA: Cooper?Where are my headphones?Lila?- COOPER: I never had them. - Lila?(BEEPING)LILA: Yeah, you had them yesterday!Lila! Lila!Yeah, Dad?Dad?Lila!(GRUNTING)Hey. Hey, look at me.You okay?Yeah. Yeah. (PANTING)It worked.It worked.STEVE: Okay, so the how works.Now, we gotta figure out the when and the where.Almost everyone in this room has had an encounter...with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.Or substitute the word \"encounter\"...for \"damn near been killed\"by one of the six Infinity Stones.Well, I haven\\'t...but I don\\'t even knowwhat the hell you\\'re all talking about.Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particlesfor one round-trip each.And these stones have beenin a lot of different places throughout history.Our history.So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?Which means we have to pick our targets.Correct.So, let\\'s start with the Aether.Thor, what do you know?NATASHA: Is he asleep?RHODES: No, no. I\\'m pretty sure he\\'s dead.Uh, where to start? Um...The Aether, firstly, is not a stone.Someone called it a stone before.Um, it\\'s more of an angry sludge sort of a thing...so someone\\'s gonna need to amend thatand stop saying that.Here\\'s an interesting story, though, about the Aether.My grandfather, many years ago...had to hide the stone from the Dark Elves.Ooh. (CHUCKLES) Scary beings.So, Jane, actually...Oh, there she is.Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.You know, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time...and then the Aether stuck itself inside her...and she became very, very sick.And so I had to take her to Asgard,which is where I\\'m from...and we had to try and fix her.We were dating at the time, you see...and I got to introduce her to my mother...(SIGHS) who\\'s dead and, um...Oh, you know, Jane and Iaren\\'t even dating anymore, so...(MOUTHING)Yes, these things happen, though. You know?Nothing lasts forever. The only thing that...- Why don\\'t you come sit down? - I\\'m not done yet.The only thing that is permanent in lifeis impermanence. (LAUGHS)Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?No. I\\'d like a Bloody Mary.ROCKET: Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.- SMART HULK: Is that a person? - No, Morag\\'s a planet.Quill was a person.Like a planet? Like in outer space?Oh, look.It\\'s like a little puppy, all happy and everything.Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy?I\\'ll take you to space.NEBULA: Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.What is Vormir?NEBULA: A dominion of death...at the very center of celestial existence.It\\'s where Thanos murdered my sister.(STEVE SIGHS)Not it.- NATASHA: That Time Stone guy. - SMART HULK: Doctor Strange.NATASHA: Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?TONY: Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit-from-hat.SMART HULK: Nice place in the Village, though.TONY: Yeah, on Sullivan Street?SMART HULK: Mm... Bleecker Street.Wait, he lived in New York?TONY: No, he lived in Toronto.Uh, yeah, on Bleecker and Sullivan.Have you been listening to anything?Guys.If you pick the right year,there are three stones in New York.Shut the front door.STEVE: All right. We have a plan.Six stones, three teams, one shot.STEVE: Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams. You know your missions. Get the stones. Get them back. One round-trip each.No mistakes...no do-overs.Most of us are going somewhere we know.That doesn\\'t mean we should know what to expect.Be careful.Look out for each other.This is the fight of our lives...and we\\'re gonna win.Whatever it takes.Good luck.He\\'s pretty good at that.- Right? - TONY: All right.You heard the man.Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.SMART HULK: Trackers engaged.You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?Yeah, yeah, yeah.Okay, I\\'ll do my best.As promises go, that was pretty lame.- (BEEPING) - See ya in a minute.(CHITAURI SNARLING)(ROARS)(ROARING)All right, we all have our assignments.Two stones uptown, one stone down.Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.(THUD)(ROARING)Maybe smash a few things along the way.I think it\\'s gratuitous, but whatever.(ROARING SOFTLY)(ROARS SOFTLY)ANCIENT ONE: I\\'d be careful going that way.We just had the floors waxed.Yeah, I\\'m looking for Doctor Strange.You\\'re about five years too early.Stephen Strange is currently performing surgeryabout 20 blocks that way.What do you want from him?That, actually.Ah!I\\'m afraid not.Sorry, but I wasn\\'t asking.You don\\'t want to do this.Ah, you\\'re right, I don\\'t. But I need that stone...and I don\\'t have time to debate it.(GRUNTS)Let\\'s start over, shall we?ASGARDIAN MAIDEN: For you, Lady Jane.JANE: Um, so you have anything with pants?ASGARDIAN MAIDEN: Pants?JANE: Never mind. These will be fine. Thank you.- ASGARDIAN MAIDEN: Yes, milady. - THOR: Oh, there\\'s Jane.All right.Here\\'s the deal, tubby.You\\'re gonna charm her,and I\\'m gonna poke her with this thing...and extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split.(SNIFFS)I\\'ll be right back, okay?The wine cellar is just down here.My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale.I\\'ll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups.Hey. Hey! Aren\\'t you drunk enough already?(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)If you could send Loki some soup.Yes, milady.And ask our librariansto pull some volumes from the astronomy shelf.Who\\'s the fancy broad?That\\'s my mother.She dies today.Oh, that is today?(BREATHES HEAVILY)I can\\'t do this. I can\\'t do this.I shouldn\\'t be here. I shouldn\\'t have come.It\\'s a bad idea!- Come here. - No, no, no.I think I\\'m having a panic attack.Come here. Right here.I shouldn\\'t be here. This is bad.You think you\\'re the only one who lost people?What do you think we\\'re doing here?I lost the only family I ever had.Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna...all gone.I get you miss your mom...but she\\'s gone.Really gone.And there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone...and you can help them.So, is it too much to askthat you brush the crumbs out of your beard...make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...and when she\\'s not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone...and help me get my family back?(SIGHS) Okay.Are you crying?(SOBBING) No.Yes.I feel like I\\'m losing it.Get it together!You can do this.(EXHALES)You can do this.(TAKING DEEP BREATHS)All right?Yes, I can.Good.I can do this. I can do this.I can\\'t do this.All right, heartbreaker, she\\'s alone.This is our shot.Thor? Thor!(GROANS)WAR MACHINE: All right, bring it down, Blue.Right on that line. That\\'s it. Down, down.(SNARLS)(SIGHS) Hey, can we hurry it up?Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We\\'re on the clock.All that is really helpful.- Take care, okay? - Yeah.Get that stone and come back. No messing around.- Hey. - We got this.- Let\\'s get it done. - Yes, sir.I\\'ll see you back.You guys watch each other\\'s six.Yeah.NEBULA: Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.All they have to do is not fall out.We\\'re a long way from Budapest.(CHUCKLES)Okay, so, uh...we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?Let\\'s take cover.We\\'re not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.Wait a minute. What are you talking about right now?Who else is looking for these stones?My father...my sister...and me.And you?Where are you right now?(YELLING)(BEEPING)(GRUNTING)(YELLING)(SIGHS)(GRUNTS)GAMORA: You\\'re welcome.I didn\\'t ask for your help.And yet, you always need it.- (SIGHS) - (CHUCKLES)Get up.

NEBULA: Let\\'s take cover. We\\'re not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones. (GRUNTS)Who was that?I don\\'t know. (GASPING)My head is splitting.

They are S.H.I.E.L.D.Well, actually Hydra, but we didn\\'t know that yet.ANT-MAN: Seriously? You didn\\'t? I mean, they look like bad guys. You\\'re small, but you\\'re talking loud.On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down?Shut up.Ooh.

I will. I promise.I can\\'t risk this reality on a promise.It\\'s the duty of the Sorcerer Supremeto protect the Time Stone.Then why the hell did Strange give it away?What did you say?Strange. He gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.- Willingly? - Yes.- Why? - I have no idea.Maybe he made a mistake.Or I did.Strange is meant to be the best of us.So, he must\\'ve done it for a reason.I fear you might be right.(SMART HULK SIGHS)Thank you.I\\'m counting on you, Bruce.We all are.Run diagnostics.Show me her memory file.Sire, the file appears entangled.It was a memory, but not hers.There\\'s another consciousness...sharing her network.Another Nebula.Impossible.EBONY MAW: This duplicate carries a time stamp...from nine years in the future.Where is this other Nebula?EBONY MAW: In our solar system on Morag.Can you access her?EBONY MAW: Yes, the two are linked.Search the duplicate\\'s memories...for Infinity Stones.BANNER: And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history. Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in. BARTON: Which means we have to pick our targets. - TONY: Correct. - THANOS: Freeze image.GAMORA: Terrans.Avengers.Unruly wretches.What\\'s that reflection?Amplify this, Maw.GAMORA: I don\\'t understand.Two Nebulas.THANOS: No. The same Nebula...from two different times.Set course for Morag.And scan the duplicate\\'s memories.I wanna see everything.My ladies, I\\'ll see you after.I\\'ll see you after.

Yes.FRIGGA: Idiot, no.A failure?Absolutely.That\\'s a little bit harsh.Do you know what that makes you?Just like everyone else.I\\'m not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?FRIGGA: Mm.Everyone fails at who they\\'re supposed to be, Thor.The measure of a person, of a hero...is how well they succeed at being who they are.I\\'ve really missed you, Mom.Thor!
